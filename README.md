# Media Peek
A pure javascript application for extracting metadata and GPS data from media files

* pull out and display metadata from within media files
* visualize the file structure in a tree-like format
* extract and display embedded GPS metadata
* NO UPLOADING; does all the work locally
* works with any size file - only reads metadata portions of the file so it's fast!
* 100% pure javascript with custom code for reading files; not built on bulky libraries

I'll try to keep a current version of this online here: https://malictus.com/mediapeek/
